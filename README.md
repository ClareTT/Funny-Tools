# ***~~Paper~~*** Funny-Tools
## Hello, my people! Happy *1024 Festival* !! Aha, today is 24th Oct, a day for __PROGRAMMERS__ :kissing_heart: . So I push the code to help us managing our papers as well as daily life that I started several months ago.     
I'll update it later, 'cause I'm going to have supper now.    
### What is updated?
Today I just fix the line link tool linelink.py again. The result is that the users' experience is more better.    
Becides, to reserve the space for more tools, the structure has been refactored.

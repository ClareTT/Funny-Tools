### Introduction
The tool wrote in python named linelink.py is to solve the problem when text in paper was copied but the format was such confusion. It help you from aspects of both transfer the format to a troditional one and remove redundant spaces.    
### How to use
There are some warning tips:
  1. Don't run the file under environments of cmd or IDLE since the input of `\n` is going to be regarded as a operation of confirm.    
  2. Anoconda is recommended to run the file. And so far that's all of the warning tips.    
##### Step 1 
After you press run there'll be some text indicates that information is going to be gathered in order to know if the main language of your passage is Chinese or English.    
##### Step 2
Then it is going to be the passage which is needed to be transfered. Copy the passage to the panel and press Enter.    
##### Step 3
Open a .doc document and paste the transferred content. In this step, just press the combination key of Ctrl+V. Do not doubt, you can do it!    

So far, you have finished all the operation steps! Your text has been pasted in the document where you need the passage to be. Actually it can be wherever you want it to be.    
The operation interface is going to be like this:

### Operation show
  1. For Chinese    
Before transferring, the passage is like this:
  ```
  应用动态差分阈值算法对脉搏信号峰值进行
提取。结果表明：该方法能够有效地检测出脉搏
信号的峰值点，与传统幅度阈值法相比，动态差分
阈值结合干扰段检测的方法准确率更高、适应性
较强。该方法运算量较小，可以满足实时信号处
理的要求。在无监督状态脉搏信号的实时分析中
具有广阔的应用前景。
```
And after, it'll going to be this with no blank space or `\n`:
  ```
